# AndroidRemote


The following App was a Senior Design Project at the University of Florida. A custom robot was created using a raspberry Pi and an Arduino.
The User was able to have two modes Autonomous mode, where the Robots camera view was displayed on the App via wifi and User mode where 
they were able to control the driving robot's movement using a virtual joystick via bluetooth. 


To assist in the creation of the App we used the following open source github code: https://github.com/zerokol/JoystickView

We also used an open soruce bluetooth project. I incorporate both of these classes along with my own to end custom messages and signals
to the robot.
